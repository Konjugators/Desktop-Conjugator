# Desktop-Conjugator
A free (when finished), standalone GUI implementation of the console-conjugator.

The GUI is implemented in Java, using the Swing libraries.
The entire application will be under package "desktop", and we will upload releases as they are availible/ready.

Progress Update November 22: GUI has been completed; To run the program, compile GUI.java and run the output. If you are windows, you may need to javac and java using encoding utf-8.
This is done as such:
```cmd
javac -encoding utf-8 GUI.java
```
